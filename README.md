# How To Install ?

At first enable the developper mode in chrome://extensions/. (on the right top corner)
Then click on the first button,labeled "Load Unpacted" on the bar that has just appeared.

Select the folder and it's good. 
Now the ducks will invade you

# Doesn't Work ?

If extension does not work, as it can be the case on OperaGX, you need to enable access to the results of the search bar. 
This is the second checkbox :
